‚úÖ What‚Äôs strong

Solid ensemble (PatchTST + iTransformer + meta-model) with multi-modal data.

Risk layer is thoughtful (trailing stops, profit lock, regime toggles).

Purged CV + OOF stacking is mentioned (keep it‚Äîthis is your credibility).

üö® Fix/clarify before you boast results

Trading thresholds conflict

You say: Long if prob_up > 52%, short if < 48%, and 95%+ confidence to trade.
Those don‚Äôt align: if ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is calibrated probability, you‚Äôll almost never hit 95%.

Fix: Define one actionable rule set, e.g.

Trade if calibrated P(up) ‚â• buy_thr_regime or ‚â§ sell_thr_regime.

Size = f( (P ‚àí 0.5), uncertainty, volatility ).

Remove/rename the ‚Äú95% confidence‚Äù line or make it a separate quality gate (e.g., conformal risk score).

Performance claims must be reproducible

‚Äú100% win rate (5/5 trades)‚Äù is anecdotal; ‚Äú+78.97% over 3.6y‚Äù must include fees, slippage, borrow costs, and survivorship handling.

Fix: Publish a single reproducible backtest report that uses:

OOF ensemble only (no in-fold leakage).

Walk-forward (train ‚â§T, test (T, T+Œî], roll).

Next bar execution (your chosen ‚Äútrade_at‚Äù: next open/close) with bps costs set per side & regime.

QQQ total-return benchmark (dividends).

Historical constituents or IPO filters to avoid survivorship bias.

OOF stacking must be real

Meta-model should train only on out-of-fold base predictions, not placeholders.

Deliverables: oof_predictions.parquet, per-model OOF IC/Precision@K, and calibration reliability plot (OOF-holdout).

Calibration without leakage

Fit isotonic/Platt only on an OOF-holdout slice by date, not the same data used to fit LGBM.

Timestamp discipline for news & fundamentals

GDELT/Reddit/StockTwits/EDGAR features must be available before the trade time.

Guardrails: lag all non-price features to T+1 close (or restrict to posts before 15:50 ET if trading at close). Log a ‚Äúfeature latency‚Äù audit.

Survivorship & corporate actions

Use adjusted prices; confirm symbol life cycles. If using ‚ÄúNASDAQ-100‚Äù, either backfill historical members or restrict to each name‚Äôs listed period.

Risk metrics parity

Report net performance with: annualized return, volatility, Sharpe/Sortino, max DD, turnover, long/short exposure, sector exposures, and hit rate per regime.

üìà Modeling upgrades (high ROI)

Regime-conditioned thresholds
Learn (buy_thr, sell_thr) per regime to maximize expected PnL after costs. Persist in regime_thresholds.json.

Uncertainty-aware sizing
Add conformal prediction or ensemble dispersion; lower size when uncertainty high or VIX elevated.

Class imbalance in meta-labels
Dead-zone >> up/down. Use class weights or downsample class 0 in LightGBM.

Champion‚ÄìChallenger
Keep current ensemble as Champion; run a challenger that adds a linear baseline (Ridge/ElasticNet on cross-sectional features) and a tree model (LightGBM direct). Promote only if OOS Sharpe improves with equal/less drawdown.

Feature governance
Save feature list + scalers per fold; add SHAP top-20 for interpretability (meta-model level).

üõ°Ô∏è Live trading hardening

Idempotent orders (SQLite ledger), duplicate-order guard, market-hours & holiday calendar checks.

Borrow checks for shorts; model penalty if borrow unavailable/expensive.

Kill-switches: data stale, error burst, DD breach, VIX circuit.

Risk budgets: max gross, per-name, sector caps; dynamic de-risk on VIX spikes.
